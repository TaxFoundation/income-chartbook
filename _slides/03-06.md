While the federal government relies on high-income households for most of its revenue, much of federal spending is directed at low-income Americans. Programs such as SNAP (food stamps), TANF (cash assistance), and Medicaid (health insurance) are designed to transfer money and other benefits to low-income households. All together, the federal system of taxes and welfare programs redistributes a considerable portion of national income. In 2012, the 20 percent lowest-income households earned 3.1 percent of national income. After federal taxes and government transfer programs, their share of national income was raised to 9.9 percent.

Taxes and transfer programs reduced the earnings of the 20 percent highest-income households from 54.7 percent of national income to 43.2 percent.
