Historically, California taxpayers have paid a larger share of their collective income to state and local taxes than the U.S. average. Currently, Californians pay 11.4 percent of their income to state and local taxes, while the total U.S. on average only pays 9.8 percent.

**Three things can change a state’s tax burden as a share of income: changes in taxes paid to other states, changes in taxes paid to the home state, and changes in state income.**
