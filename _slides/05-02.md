While the U.S. collects lower taxes than other nations, this does not always mean that the U.S. has a lower tax burden across the board. This is because the U.S. tax system has a significantly different structure than most countries in the developed world. U.S. federal, state, and local governments rely on individual income taxes, corporate income taxes, and property taxes for most of their revenues. Meanwhile, most other developed nations rely more heavily on social insurance taxes (such as payroll taxes on labor) and consumption taxes (such as value-added taxes).

In 2012, individual income taxes made up 37.7 percent of U.S. federal, state, and local tax revenues. For the OECD at large, income taxes comprised only 24.5 percent of revenues, on average.
