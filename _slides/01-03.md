The San Diego metropolitan area economy relies much more on government, real estate, and professional, scientific, and technical services than the U.S. metro average. At 21 percent of San Diego’s economy, government is far more prominent than in most metro areas. This is largely a reflection of sizable military and other federal employment. San Diego, like many California cities, also has a large real estate sector.
