Once federal taxes are collected, they are used to pay for a variety of federal spending programs, ranging from Air Force fighter jets to health insurance subsidies. In 2015, the federal government spent 68 percent of its budget on "mandatory" spending programs, such as Social Security, Medicare, and interest payments on the debt. This means that only one out of three dollars of federal spending goes through the Congressional appropriations process each year; the majority of the budget is on "auto-pilot." Some of the spending programs that Congress does budget for each year include military spending and income security programs.

8.9 percent of the federal budget goes to "everything else," which includes spending on education, agriculture, transportation, housing, and foreign affairs.
