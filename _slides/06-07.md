The mortgage interest deduction allows taxpayers who own their homes to deduct up to $1 million of mortgage interest payments. In theory, the mortgage interest deduction prevents housing payments from double taxation; this is why eliminating it would shrink the economy by 0.35 percent. However, in practice, the mortgage interest deduction costs the federal government $75 billion in lost revenue each year and distorts investment toward owner-occupied housing. Eliminating the mortgage interest deduction and using the revenue for an income tax cut would grow the economy by 2.39 percent.

By itself, ending the mortgage interest deduction would shrink the economy by 0.35 percent. But, accompanied with a revenue-neutral rate cut, it would grow the economy by 2.39 percent.
