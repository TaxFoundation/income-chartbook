The tax code also affects decisions about household saving. The U.S. tax code gives taxpayers strong incentives to spend their income immediately, rather than saving it. After taxes, a single taxpayer earning $100,000 has 81.8 percent of her income free to spend on consumption. But if the taxpayer chose instead to put her income into savings for 20 years, she would only be left with 72.7 percent of her income available to be used for consumption. This is because income from saving—such as capital gains and dividends—is subject to a second level of federal taxation, which makes saving less desirable.

American taxpayers who choose to save their money, rather than consume, face two levels of taxation: when the money is earned and after it is withdrawn from saving.

> Note: Assumes a single taxpayer, earning a $100,000 salary and taking the standard deduction. Assumes a 7 percent annual rate of return on investment, a 7 percent annual discount rate, and a tax rate of 15 percent on capital gains at the end of the period. Does not account for tax-free savings accounts.
