Because the U.S. tax system is designed to transfer money to low-income families, the typical household making under $40,000 faces a negative tax burden: it pays less money in taxes than it receives through the tax code, in the form of a refund. This is mostly due to refundable tax credits, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). However, the EITC is designed so that it phases out for families earning above the federal poverty line. As the EITC phases out, each additional dollar a household makes leads to a smaller refund and a higher tax burden. Because of this, once a household crosses the federal poverty line, its tax burden begins to increase rapidly.

Once a four-person household's income hits $23,630, the Earned Income Tax Credit begins to phase out, and its tax burden starts to rise quickly.
