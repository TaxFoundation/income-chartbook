One of the most overlooked explanations for income inequality is that income rises over the course of a lifetime. Most people make relatively little money at the beginning of their careers, with their highest incomes coming right before retirement. As a result, a portion of the income disparity between Americans is simply an age disparity - many college students are counted among the poorest Americans today but will be among the richest by the time they retire. As the Baby Boomer generation has moved into its peak earning years, the number of high-income taxpayers near retirement has increased, giving the appearance of rising inequality.

In 2013, the highest earning Americans were those between 55 and 64 years old, who made an average $87,882 in household income. Americans between 26 and 34 only earned an average $43,936 in household income.
