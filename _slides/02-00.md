San Diego has a moderately-sized city government compared to other California cities and obtains the greatest share of total revenue from taxes. Tax collections in San Diego have risen over time and appear to be returning to the historic high levels seen in the late 2000s. These tax collections mostly come from taxes on property and retail sales, but San Diego also levies taxes on hotel rooms and has business franchise fees. Local sales taxes in the city tend to be lower than most other California cities.

On the expenditure side, San Diego spends the largest share of its total government revenue on public safety, just like many of the other California cities examined here. Total debt per person in San Diego is low.
