Description: Over the last thirty years, high-income households have become responsible for more of the income tax burden. The 10 percent highest-income taxpayers now pay 70.2 percent of all income taxes, up from 54.7 percent in 1986. This trend has been largely driven by the growing incomes of the richest Americans,  as well as the expansion of tax credits aimed at low-income Americans. Since 2003, the top 1 percent of taxpayers have paid a greater share of federal income taxes than the bottom 90 percent combined.						

```
The top 1 percent of taxpayers pay 38.1 percent of all income taxes. The bottom 50 percent of taxpayers pay only 2.8 percent of all income taxes.
