In 2015, California ranks 48th out of the 50 states on the Tax Foundation’s State Business Tax Climate Index, which annually compares the states’ tax systems on over 100 variables that impact business. In other words, California has the 3rd worst business tax climate when compared to other states.

California ranks 4th highest on the Annual State-Local Tax Burden Rankings, which estimates state and local taxes paid by taxpayers to their states of residence and other states. An estimated 11.4 percent of California’s collective income goes toward state and local taxes (above the national average of 9.8 percent).

Tax Freedom Day is the day when taxpayers have earned enough to pay their total combined federal, state, and local tax bill for the year. In 2015, California taxpayers worked 122 days into the year (until May
3) to pay their total tax bill. Forty-six states celebrated Tax Freedom Day before California.

> Note: The Annual State-Local Tax Burden Rankings is calculated annually using the most recently available data. For a full list of definitional terms and methodology, see Tax Foundation Working Paper No. 10.
