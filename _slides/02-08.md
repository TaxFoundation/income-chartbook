One of the important factors that shapes the distribution of income in America is education. On average, individuals with higher levels of education earn much higher incomes. In particular, bachelor's degrees are associated with significantly higher income levels. The average annual income for Americans with a bachelor's degree is $95,042, compared to an annual income of $59,517 for Americans who started college but did not earn a degree. In many ways, America's income gap is now an education gap, as most high-income households also have high education levels.						

> Americans with master's degrees make, on average, over three times the income of Americans who have not graduated high school.
