Title: "Working Class American Families Face Marginal Tax Rates up to 43.7%"
Subtitle: "Implicit Marginal Income and Payroll Tax Rates for a Married Household with Two Children (2015)"
---
Description: One of the most important features of any tax code is the marginal tax rates: a measure of how quickly a household's tax burden grows with each additional dollar it makes. Usually, a household's marginal tax rate is the same as the rate of whatever income tax bracket it falls into, plus the payroll tax rate. However, for households making between $23,500 and $50,000, the phase-out of the Earned Income Tax Credit creates marginal tax rates as high as 43.7 percentâ€”higher than the top income tax bracket. With such high marginal tax rates, it is expensive for households making between $23,500 and $50,000 to increase their work hours or move to higher-paying jobs.

A family of four making $48,000 sees its tax burden increase by 43.7 cents for the next dollar it makes.
