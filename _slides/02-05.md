The state of California has a 6.5 percent sales tax, but it’s important to remember that local sales taxes are collected in addition to this. A mandatory local-level tax of one percent is levied throughout the state, however many counties and cities collect additional local sales taxes on top of this. In San Diego, the combined rate is 8 percent – not the lowest in the state, but lowest among our selected cities.

> Note: The mandatory statewide local add-on sales tax of 1 percent is included as part of the local average sales tax rate here.
