Another factor that complicates the conventional story about income inequality is how worker pay has changed over time. Fifty years ago, it was still relatively uncommon to offer workers benefits other than their regular wages and salaries; in 1965, only 10.5 percent of worker compensation was in the form of benefits. Now, almost 20 percent of all worker compensation takes the form of health insurance, 401(k) plans, pensions, and other benefits. Most of these benefits are not captured in government income data, giving the impression that workers are paid less than they actually are.

In 1929, wages and salaries made up 98.1 percent of total worker compensation. By 2014, wages and salaries only accounted for 80.8 percent of worker compensation.
