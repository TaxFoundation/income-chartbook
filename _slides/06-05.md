Tax rate cuts are expensive for the federal government, and politicians often propose paying for rate cuts by eliminating or limiting itemized deductions. One of the most significant itemized deductions is the deduction for state and local taxes paid, which cost the federal government almost $81 billion in 2015. This deduction largely benefits households in high-tax states, such as New Jersey and California. Eliminating the state and local taxes deduction would lead to a higher tax burden on work and investment, decreasing the size of the economy by 0.25 percent. However, if the revenues from eliminating the state and local tax deduction were used to cut the overall income tax rate, significant economic growth would result.

Eliminating the deduction for state and local taxes and using the revenues to cut the individual income tax rate would grow the economy by 2.58 percent.
