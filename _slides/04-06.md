Not only does the tax code affect decisions about work and saving, but it also creates a complex and confusing set of incentives for individuals who are considering marriage. Two individuals with no children can receive a tax bonus of up to 7 percent or face a tax penalty of up to 4.3 percent of their income for marrying. The tax bonus or penalty from marriage depends on the couple's combined income, as well as how evenly the income is split between the two spouses. The tax code tends to treat single-earner households more favorably, while penalizing spouses with similar income levels.

For two individuals without children, one of whom earns $75,000 and one of whom earns $25,000, getting married would save the couple roughly $2,500 in taxes.
