Many economists believe that long-term growth is driven by investment. As a result, taxes on capital gains and dividends are particularly harmful for economic growth, because they make it more difficult to invest. Currently, the top federal tax rate on capital gains and dividends is 23.8 percent, in addition to several other layers of taxation on savings and investment. Raising the top tax rate on capital gains and dividends to 40 percent would only increase federal revenue by 1.16 percent, because of the negative effects on long-term economic growth that would result.						

```
Eliminating taxes on capital gains and dividends would grow the economy by 3.29 percent. This would cost the federal government $138 billion a year, or 3.56 percent of its revenue.
