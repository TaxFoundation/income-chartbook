Over the last 60 years, the U.S. tax code has grown drastically in size and complexity. Today, the tax code and tax regulations are seven times longer than they were in 1955, growing from 1.4 million words to over 10 million. This complexity creates real costs for taxpayers: every year, Americans spend over 6 billion hours complying with tax filing requirements, and over 55 percent of taxpayers now hire professional tax preparers. Overall, tax code compliance costs the U.S. economy over $150 billion a year.

> In 2014, the federal tax code contained 2.4 million words, while federal tax regulations were 7.6 million words long. At average reading speed, it would take five weeks to read both, if one did not sleep, eat, or comprehend any of it.

> 2013 figures have been adjusted downward from a simple word count of the tax and regulatory codes, in order not to avoid measuring the length of appendices, tables of contents, references, etc.
