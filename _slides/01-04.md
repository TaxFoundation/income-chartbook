San Diego employers tend to be on the smaller side, which is true for most areas. 74 percent of San Diego employers have fewer than 10 employees. Although only 5 percent of employers have more than 50 employees, these large firms employ a significant portion of San Diegoâ€™s workforce.

Even though firms employing hundreds of people are very prominent, such as major manufacturers, they often rely on many smaller suppliers in the local economy to provide intermediate goods and services.
