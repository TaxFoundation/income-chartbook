Most measures of income inequality look at how income is distributed among households, rather than among individuals. This leads to some odd results, because income disparities between households often boil down to how many members of the household are earning money. Households with higher income tend to include two or more individuals who earn money, while many households with lower income contain no wage earners at all. So, even if income were distributed perfectly equally among individuals, household incomes would still look substantially unequal.
