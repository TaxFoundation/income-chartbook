Eight out of every ten dollars that the federal government collects come from just two sources: individual income taxes and payroll taxes. Individual income taxes are paid by households each April, while payroll taxes are removed automatically from employees' paychecks. Together, these taxes raise $2.5 trillion every year. The other three major sources of federal revenue - corporate income taxes, excise taxes, and estate taxes - are much less significant, raising only about $440 billion. Besides taxes, the federal government also collects a small amount of money from fines, fees, tariffs on overseas trade, and the income of the Federal Reserve.

In 2015, 47.4 percent of federal revenue came from individual income taxes, for a total of $1.5 trillion.
