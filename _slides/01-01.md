For this chart book, we’ve selected four other California cities to compare to San Diego on a wide range of economic, demographic, and budget metrics. We’ll look at San Diego in the context of Fresno, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Jose. We chose these four cities because of their varied locations within California and their differences in population. Los Angeles is the largest of the five cities with 3.96 million people. With a population of 1.37 million, San Diego is smaller than L.A. but bigger than San Jose (1.02 million people), San Francisco (846,000 people), and Fresno (520,000 people).

In some cases, we look at the surrounding metropolitan area of each of these cities.

> Note: The size of cities’ dots is related to population size (larger cities have larger dots). Population estimates are rounded to the nearest ten thousand for cities with more than one million people and to the nearest thousand for cities with fewer than one million people.
