While cutting individual income tax rates would help grow the economy, cutting the corporate tax rate would be even more effective at creating growth. This is because only about a third of the burden of the individual income tax falls on investment, while almost the entire burden of the corporate income tax falls on investments. Lowering the top individual tax rate to 25 percent would grow the economy by 1.30 percent, while cutting the corporate top rate to 25 percent would grow the economy by 2.29 percent.

Cutting both the top individual income tax rate and the top corporate income tax rate to 25 percent would grow the economy by 3.67 percent.
