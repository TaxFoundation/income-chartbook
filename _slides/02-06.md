American society looks different today than it did in the 1960s, and the social changes of the past half century are reflected in tax collections as well. Fifty years ago, 65.2 percent of tax filing households were married couples. Since then, the number of single taxpayers has risen steadily, and singles now account for 61.5 percent of tax filers. While the percentage of married couples is dwindling, many of these couples report higher-than-average household income, especially married couples with two earners.						

> Between 1960 and 2013, the share of tax returns filed by married households fell from 65.2 percent to 38.5 percent.
