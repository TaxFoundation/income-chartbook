While the U.S. imposes a lower average tax burden on labor income than the rest of the developed world, the U.S. still levies higher marginal tax rates on labor than many other nations. When taking into account federal, state, and local income and payroll taxes, the top marginal tax rate on labor income in the United States is 48.6 percent. This is one indication that the U.S. tax code is more progressive compared to other nations: it imposes higher-than-average rates on the wealthiest while collecting a lower-than-average burden overall.
