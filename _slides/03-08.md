At 13.3 percent, California’s top income tax rate is currently the highest in the country and the second highest it has ever been in the state’s history. As recently as the early 2000s, income tax rates were substantially lower than current rates (though still above most other states).

**Income tax increases that went into effect in 2013 gave California the highest top state income tax rate in the nation by a wide margin (the second highest is Hawaii’s at 11 percent).**
