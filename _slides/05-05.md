Description: In contrast to the U.S.'s high rates on capital gains and dividends, the U.S. tax burden on labor is decidedly lower than average for the developed world. American workers are subject to multiple taxes on their labor income: both payroll and income taxes, at the federal, state, and local levels. In 2014, due to all of these taxes combined, U.S. workers saw their labor income lowered by 31.5 percent, on average. This combined rate on labor income is the tenth lowest among developed nations.

The average U.S. tax burden on labor income is 31.5 percent, over four points lower than the OECD average rate of 36.0 percent.
