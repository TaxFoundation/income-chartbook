title: "California’s Business Tax Climate Falls behind Regionally"
subtitle: "State Business Tax Climate Index Rankings, California and Select States in the Region (2015)"

Breaking the *State Business Tax Climate Index* into its subcomponents allows us to compare the structure of each major tax type. California’s neighboring states offer more competitive tax climates in nearly all categories. Property taxes are California’s strength, though deficiencies in the individual income tax and sales tax make the state score among the worst overall.

> Note: A rank of 1 indicates the state’s tax system is more favorable for business; a rank of 50 indicates
the state’s tax system is less favorable for business. Snapshot date is July 1, 2014. Component rankings do not average to the overall rank. States without a given tax rank equally as number 1 in that component.
