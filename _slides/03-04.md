Payroll taxes, excise taxes, and corporate taxes are not nearly as progressive as individual income taxes. Nevertheless, even when these taxes are considered, the entire federal tax system remains quite progressive: as individuals move into higher income groups, they pay a higher combined tax rate. One exception is households that make less than $10,000, who pay an average of 10.6 percent of their income in taxes. This is because many of the most generous provisions of the income tax code do not fully phase in for households with such low income levels.

```
Households making less than $100,000 typically pay far less than the average federal tax rate of 21.0%. Those making over $1 million pay an average tax rate of 33.1%.
