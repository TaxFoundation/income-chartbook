One area of the U.S. tax code that imposes a higher tax burden than most other developed nations is the taxation of capital gains. When a U.S. household sells an investment, a home, or another asset for a profit, it is required to pay rates of up to 28.6 percent on the capital gain. The U.S. top tax rate on capital gains is the sixth highest in the developed world, placing a large burden on Americans who save and invest. Meanwhile, nine developed countries do not tax capital gains at all.

```
While the average top marginal tax rate on capital gains in developed countries is 18.4 percent, the U.S. top marginal rate is over 10 points higher, at 28.6 percent.
