This page provides a brief, broad overview of tax rates, tax collections, and other basic structural features of the California system.

> Note: All collections listed on this page are combined state and local per capita collections for the 2012 fiscal year. Income, federal aid, and state debt are for 2013. Individual and corporate income tax rates are ranked according to the top rate if a state has a graduated- rate individual or corporate income tax. “State debt”
is the total outstanding debt at the end of the fiscal year, as defined by the Census Bureau. The mandatory statewide local add-on sales tax of 1 percent is included as part of the local average sales tax rate here.
