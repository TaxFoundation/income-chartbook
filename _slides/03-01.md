title: "The Federal Income Tax Has a Progressive Structure"
subtitle: "Average Individual Income Tax Rates, by Income Group (2015, Projected)"

Description: A tax is progressive if it imposes higher rates on individuals with higher incomes. Several features of the federal income tax make it a progressive tax, including many provisions targeted at easing the tax burden for low-income individuals. In fact, households with incomes less than $40,000 typically end up receiving additional income through the tax code, due to refundable credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit. For instance, households making between $10,000 and $20,000 face an income tax rate of -11 percent, which means that they receive $11 through the income tax code for every $100 they make.						

```
Households making over $1 million in 2015 pay 27.4 percent of their incomes in income taxes, more than twice the average income tax rate of 10.1 percent.
