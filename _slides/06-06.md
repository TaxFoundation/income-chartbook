subtitle: "Economic Effects of Eliminating the Charitable Deduction (2015)"
---
One of the most popular itemized deductions in the tax code is the charitable deduction. There are over one million tax-exempt charitable organizations in the United States, and contributions made to any of these organizations are tax deductable, for individuals who itemize their deductions. Eliminating the charitable deduction would decrease the size of the economy by 0.10 percent, due to the resulting higher tax burden. However, the economy would grow by 0.98 percent if the revenues from eliminating the charitable deduction were used to cut the income tax rate.

In 2015, the deduction for charitable contributions cost the federal government $58 billion in lost revenue.
