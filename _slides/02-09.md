While most discussions of inequality in America center around income inequality, other measures of inequality tell slightly different stories. In particular, the amount that households consume in the United States is distributed much more equally than income is. While the lowest-income Americans earned only 3.6 percent of national income between July 2013 and June 2014, they accounted for 8.8 percent of all consumption. One explanation for why consumption inequality is lower is that, while incomes swing up and down from year to year, household consumption stays relatively steady.						

> The 20 percent highest-income Americans receive 47.8 percent of national income but only account for 38.9 percent of national consumption.

> Note: Income statistics differ slightly from those presented earlier, from the Current Population Survey. Quintiles consist of consumer units, sorted by before-tax income. Consumption inequality figures may inaccurately capture durable good consumption. For more information, see Hassett and Mathur (2012).
