Sources of federal revenue have changed dramatically over the last eighty years. Payroll taxes have become increasingly important, due to the creation of Social Security in the 1930s and Medicare and Medicaid in the 1960s. Corporate income taxes have declined as a source of revenue, from 35.8 percent of federal revenue in 1945 to 10.8 percent today. In part, this is because more business income is now taxed on individual tax returns, rather than corporate returns. Excise taxes, such as alcohol and tobacco taxes, which once accounted for over a third of federal revenues, now only make up 3 percent.

Between 1935 and 2015, the individual income tax has risen from 14.6 percent of federal revenue to 46.2 percent. Individual income tax collections are set to rise even further over the next five years.
