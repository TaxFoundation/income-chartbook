Generally speaking, there are two ways for individuals to earn income in any economy: labor and investments. Most Americans making less than $1 million earn the majority of their income through labor, in the form of wages and salaries. These families typically only begin to receive substantial investment income when they retire, through IRAs and pensions. On the other hand, Americans earning over $1 million make most 42.6 percent of their income through investments and 24.2 percent from businesses they own and operate.						

```
For Americans making between $50,000 and $100,000, wages and salaries account for 70.5 percent of their income. Among Americans making over $1 million, wages and salaries only comprise 29.1 percent of income.						>
