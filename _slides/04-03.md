title: "A Single Parent Making $4,800 Has Almost as Much Take-Home Income as One Making $21,000"
subtitle: "Disposable Income for a Hypothetical Single Parent with One Child (2012)"
---
Description: As low-income households earn more money, not only do their tax burdens grow rapidly, but they also receive fewer benefits from federal social assistance programs. In fact, individuals who move to higher-paying jobs sometimes end up with less overall disposable income, after taxes and transfers. In this way, the federal system of taxes and benefits distorts individuals' work decisions, making it more difficult for low-income individuals to increase their incomes through the labor market.

```
A typical single parent with one child could earn $16,200 more in wages and only see $1,967 more in additional take-home income, because of higher taxes and fewer federal benefits.
