No two tax cuts impact the economy in the same way. All four tax cuts shown in the graph would reduce federal revenue by $670 billion over 10 years. However, some would lead to more economic growth than others. Doubling the Child Tax Credit to $2,000 would not significantly affect individuals' incentives to work and invest, and would only produce minimal growth. Cutting the lowest income tax bracket would reduce the cost of labor and grow the economy by 0.15 percent. Cutting the top income bracket would grow the economy by 0.65 percent. Finally, cutting rates on capital gains and dividends would encourage investment and lead to 1.13 percent growth.

Reducing the top rate on capital gains to 14.7 percent would cause over 20 times as much economic growth as doubling the Child Tax Credit, for the same cost.
