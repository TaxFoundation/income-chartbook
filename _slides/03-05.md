California’s inflation-adjusted combined state-local tax collections have risen from approximately $37.5 billion in 1961 to $183.7 billion in 2012. Since 1961, state tax collections have grown from 46 percent of the combined total to 63 percent. Local tax collections have shrunk from 54 percent of the total to 37 percent.

> Note: Dollar amounts are inflation adjusted based on the annual average Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) with a 2012 base year. Because local data is unavailable for 2001 and 2003, those points were excluded here, and that area of the chart is filled in with a lighter shade to denote the difference.
