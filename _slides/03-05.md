title: "Almost Half of Federal Revenues Come from Households Making over $200,000"
subtitle: "Share of Total Income and of All Federal Taxes, by Income Group (2015, Projected)"
---
When all federal taxes are taken into account, the federal government relies on high-income households for most of its revenue. These households earn a large share of all income, but pay an even larger share of all federal taxes. Households making more than $1 million earn 13.7 percent of all income but pay 21.6 percent of total taxes. On the flipside, while households earning less than $100,000 make 38.8 percent of all income, they pay only 23.3 percent of federal taxes. In this way, most low-income households face a much smaller tax burden than average, both as a share of their income and as a share of the total tax burden.						

```
Households that make more than $200,000 earn 34.5 percent of national income, but pay 49.3 percent of all federal taxes.
