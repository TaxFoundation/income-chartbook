Because individual income taxes influence decisions about work and investment, changing the income tax rate can affect economic growth. Currently, ordinary income (such as wages and salaries) is taxed at a top rate of 39.6 percent. Raising the top tax rate to 60 percent would bring in significantly more federal revenue, but would shrink the economy by 2 percent, due mostly to an increased burden on pass-through business income. On the other hand, lowering the top tax rate to 15 percent would grow the economy by 3.3 percent, even though doing so would lead to lower federal revenue.

```
Blurb: Cutting the top tax rate on ordinary income to 25 percent would grow the economy by 1.3 percent. Doing so would cost the government $102 billion a year, or 2.6 percent of total federal revenue.
