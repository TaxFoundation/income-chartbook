In addition to inequality, many voters are concerned about income mobility: the chances for each new generation to move up or down the income ladder from where they were born. The evidence is clear that, although family income at birth has some effect on income in adulthood, most Americans do not end up in the same income group they were born in. For instance, a child born into the middle income quintile has a 17.78 percent chance of ending up in the lowest quintile and a 18.25 percent chance of ending up in the highest. The data also shows that, although income inequality has increased since the 1970s, relative income mobility remains as high today as it was 40 years ago.

A child born in the lowest income group has a 66.32 percent chance of moving out of that group by adulthood. A child born in the highest income group has a 63.48 percent chance of ending up in a lower one.
