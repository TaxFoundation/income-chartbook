Title: "Low-Income Americans See the Most Benefits for Each Dollar Paid in Federal Taxes"
Subtitle: "Federal Spending Received per Dollar Paid in Federal Taxes, by Income Group (2012)"
---
Description: Low-income Americans benefit most from the federal system of taxes and transfers, because they pay relatively low taxes but receive a large share of government spending. For every dollar that the 20 percent lowest-income Americans pay in federal taxes, they receive $8.13 in federal spending. On the flip side, high-income Americans bear most of the cost of the federal government and receive only a limited portion of federal spending. The 20 percent highest-income American households receive only $0.25 in federal spending for every dollar they pay in federal taxes.

```
For every $1.00 that the middle income quintile of Americans pay in federal taxes, they receive $1.59 in federal spending.
