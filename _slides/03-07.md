title: "Effective Business Tax Rates in California Vary Widely by Industry"
subtitle: "Total Effective Tax Rates by Firm Type and Tax Type, Firms in California (2014)"
---
The Tax Foundation’s Location Matters study calculates the tax bills in every state for 14 hypothetical firms (one new and one mature) in seven different industries. Under the existing California tax code, new and mature firms tend to be treated differently. Much of California’s high tax costs are due to economically-damaging taxes charged on business inputs, such as property taxes on equipment and sales taxes on machinery. This disproportionately affects new firms trying to buy the necessary capital needed to operate. Ideally, firms in the same industry should face the same effective tax rate, regardless of whether they are new or mature.

> Note: “Total Effective Tax Rate” only includes state and local tax liability, not federal tax liability.
