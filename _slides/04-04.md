Title: "High-Income American Families Can Face Marginal Tax Rates over 40%"
Subtitle: "Implicit Marginal Income and Payroll Tax Rates for a Married Household with Two Children (2015)"
---
Description: While the effects of the tax code on labor earnings are most noticeable for individuals just above the poverty line, American workers of all income levels can face a substantial tax burden on their added work effort. Almost all U.S. households making over $100,000 face rates of over 30 percent on each additional dollar they earn. These high rates almost certainly affect decisions about work and employment among workers on the margin; they also influence the investment decisions of entrepreneurs and small business owners, who pay individual income taxes on their business earnings.						

```
A hypothetical family of four making more than $485,000 in labor income pays a tax rate of 41.2 percent on each additional dollar it earns.
```

>Note: The calculations apply for a married couple, filing jointly, with two children, with equal incomes, that only earns labor income. The couple is assumed to switch to itemized deductions (a deduction of 5 percent for state and local taxes) when optimal.
