Cities and metro areas form the basic building blocks for modern economies, and their successes (or failures) drive national economic performance.

The charts in this chapter illustrate the current state of the San Diego economy, in addition to how it has fared over time. We show various economic indicators, including age of population, industry mix, employment composition, employment to population ratio, average wage per job, and price of electricity. In many cases, we compare San Diego to four other California cities: Fresno, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Jose.
