Today, the individual income tax is the single most important source of federal revenue, but it wasnâ€™t always that way. In 1936, excise taxes, such as tobacco and alcohol taxes, brought in more money than any other revenue source. Then, in 1943, the corporate income tax briefly became the most important source of federal revenue.

But since the end of World War II, the story of American tax policy has been the rising importance of taxes on individual income. Today, 47 percent of all federal revenue comes from the individual income tax, while payroll taxes account for another 33 percent.

As the individual income tax has become more important, it has also grown more complicated. In the last fifty years, the length of the tax code and associated regulations has almost tripled. Individual taxpayers now spend billions of hours every year complying with income tax filing requirements.

The most important cause of the complexity of the income tax is the ever-growing tangle of credits, deductions, and other special provisions in the tax code. Justified or not, these credits and deductions reduce Americans' tax payments by over $1 trillion every year.

So, the individual income tax is both very important and poorly-constructed. It is this combination that makes the income tax such a promising target for reform.
