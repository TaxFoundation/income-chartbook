The *State Business Tax Climate Index* gauges how well structured each state’s tax code is for business. States that score well in the Index have broad bases and low rates, but California scores 48th for its narrow bases and high rates. California is the only bottom-ten state on the West Coast, facing stiff competition from better-ranked states like Nevada, Utah, Washington, and Oregon.

> Note: A rank of 1 indicates the state’s tax system is more favorable for business; a rank of 50 indicates
the state’s tax system is less favorable for business. Snapshot date is July 1, 2014. DC’s rank does not affect states’ rankings, but the figure in parentheses indicates where it would rank if included.
