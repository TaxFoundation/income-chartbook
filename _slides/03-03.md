Although there is extensive public discussion of whether the individual income tax should be more progressive or less so, it is indisputable that the current system is progressive; the top 1 percent highest-earning taxpayers pay much more in income taxes than most Americans, even after credits and deductions. In 2013, the top 1 percent of taxpayers paid an average income tax rate of 27.1 percent, while all other Americans paid an average income tax rate of 10.5 percent. The total income tax burden of the top 1 percent of taxpayers in 2013 was $465 billion, 38 percent of all income taxes paid.

The average income tax rate for the top 1 percent highest-income households has fluctuated significantly since 1986, rising slightly in 2013 to 27.1 percent.
