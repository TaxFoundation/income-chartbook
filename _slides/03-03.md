subtitle: "Average Income Tax Rate, for Selected Income Groups (1986â€“2012)"

Although there is extensive public discussion of whether the individual income tax should be more progressive or less so, it is indisputable that the current system is progressive, with the 1 top percent highest-earning taxpayers paying much more in income taxes than most Americans, even after credits and deductions. In 2012, the top 1 percent of taxpayers had an average income tax rate of 23 percent, while all other Americans had an average income tax rate of 10 percent. The total income tax burden of the top 1 percent of taxpayers in 2012 was $451 billion, 38 percent of all income taxes paid.

The average income tax rate for the top 1 percent highest-income households has fluctuated significantly since 1986, falling slightly in 2012 to 23 percent.
