Title: "The U.S. Collects Less in Taxes than Other Developed Nations"
Subtitle: "Government Tax Revenues, by OECD Country, as a Percentage of Gross Domestic Product (2012)"
---
Most other developed nations bring in much higher levels of tax revenue than the United States does. The average member country of the OECD collects 33.7 percent of GDP in tax revenues, while U.S. federal, state, and local governments collect 24.4 percent of GDP in taxes. Only two countries, Chile and Mexico, collect less in taxes, as a portion of their economies, than the U.S. does. Other countries, such as Denmark, collect almost double the level of tax revenue that the U.S. does, in order to fund governments that are significantly bigger than that of the U.S.

The Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) is a group of 34 developed countries, which often serve as a useful comparison to the United States.
