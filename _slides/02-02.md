Cities have five major tools in their revenue toolkits: taxes, intergovernmental revenue, revenue from city-owned activities (such as utilities), other program charges (such as service charges, fines, or fees), and miscellaneous general revenue. San Diego depended on taxes for 39 percent of its total revenue in the 2014 fiscal year.

> Note: “Intergovernmental Revenue” includes dedicated operating and capital grants and contributions
for specific programs and functions. “City-Owned Enterprises” include charges for services rendered by city-owned business-type activities, such as utilities, airports, development services, environmental services, golf courses, and recycling. “Other Program Charges” include charges for government services rendered (such as those related to transportation or sanitation and health, among others). “Misc. General Revenue” includes non-restricted grants and contributions, investment and interest income, and other miscellaneous revenue sources. For specific details about what is included in each category, see city Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports.
