Every year since 1929, roughly 72 percent of national income has gone to pay individuals for their labor, while 28 percent has gone to individuals who make capital investments. This is a striking trend: amidst the tumultuous changes of the 20th century - wars, recessions, globalization, and technology - the distribution of national income between labor and capital has remained virtually constant. Though some worry that capital income will increase as a share of the economy in the future (leading to more income for the wealthy), no evidence of this trend has shown up in the data.

In 2014, 70.3 percent of national income went to labor, through wages, salaries, and other worker compensation. The other 29.7 percent went to investors of capital, in the form of rent, dividends, and other investment income.

"Labor Income" consists of all compensation of employees. "Capital Income" consists of the net operating surplus of private enterprise before corporate income taxes.
