Much of the complexity in the federal tax code spends from tax expenditures - over 150 deductions, credits, and other provisions that reduce people's tax burdens from what they would owe under a simple income tax. For example, the federal tax code does not treat health insurance provided by employers as income, even though it is a significant portion of worker compensation. If this compensation were taxed at normal rates, the federal government could raise over $206.4 billion in revenue each year. Most tax expenditures are simply subsidies for favored industries and activities - but some, such as 401(k) plans and low rates on capital gains, properly protect savings and investment from double taxation.

In 2015, the ten largest individual tax expenditures are expected to reduce federal revenue by $784 billion, more than the entire defense budget.
