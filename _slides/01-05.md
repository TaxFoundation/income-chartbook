The employment-to-population ratio shows the percentage of an area’s population that is employed. When this value rises, jobs are being created faster than the population is growing. San Diego’s ratio was 60.3 percent in 2013 – above Fresno (48.1 percent in 2013) but below Los Angeles (60.6 percent in 2013), San Francisco (65.6 percent in 2013), and San Jose (65.8 percent in 2013). From 1969 to 2013, the employment-to-population ratio rose 12 percent in San Diego. Notably, San Diego’s economy proved resilient during and after the 2001 recession but performed less favorably during the most recent recession in the late
2000s.
