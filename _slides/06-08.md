subtitle: "Economic Effects of Capping Itemized Deductions at $25,000 (2015)"
---
There are over one dozen itemized deductions available to taxpayers, which are mostly claimed by high-income taxpayers. Some politicians have proposed capping the total amount of itemized deductions that a taxpayer can claim, as a way of simplifying the tax code and raising additional federal revenue. While imposing a cap on itemized deductions would be a significant tax hike, it would decrease the size of the economy by only 0.14 percent. However, if the revenues were used to pay for a rate cut, the size of the economy would grow by 2.99 percent.

```Capping itemized deductions at $25,000 would bring in $126 billion in additional annual revenues, a 4.04 percent increase in federal tax collections.```
