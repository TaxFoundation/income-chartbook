From 1990 until 2000, San Diego’s tax collections rose very slowly in real terms to $646 per capita. But during the 2000s, rising property values led to a dramatic increase in property tax collections. Since a peak in 2009 of $1,034 per capita, collections have fallen to $859 per capita in 2014. This shift is almost entirely due to property tax collections falling after the real estate bubble burst.

> Note: Dollar amounts are inflation adjusted based on the annual average Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) with a 2014 base year. “Property Taxes” include special assessments. Prior to 2004, hotel taxes were reported as a component of “Other Taxes.” Note that “Other Taxes” include franchise fees (this is the largest share of the “Other Taxes” category).
