Over the last few years, conversations about income in the United States have often focused on the topic of income inequality. Beginning in 1970, the gap between rich and poor Americans widened as the wealthiest households started to see their share of national income increase. While every income group is richer today than in 1970, the incomes of the top 20% of Americans have grown faster. Several explanations have been proposed to account for this increase in inequality, including globalization, innovations in technology, and changes in federal policy.

In 2013, the top 20 percent highest-income households earned 48.8 percent of all national income, up from 40.9 percent in 1970.
